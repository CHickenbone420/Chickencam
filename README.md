Don't pm me simple questions such as grade/sdk version not being the right version! **GOOGLE FIRST!!!!**

If you get an error such as "App cannot be installed" then either you forgot or pasted your code in the wrong spot, or the it's on the wrong android version.

To fix the android version compability issue, On the top of android studio click Tools>Android>SDK Manager. Then install your version and sync your project by going to File>Sync
